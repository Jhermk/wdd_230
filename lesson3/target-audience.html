        <ol>
            <li>
               Hermann is a chief, and he has a small restaurant with so many clients eating thousands of meal every day. As he wants to build a bigger
               restaurant, he is browsing on the internet to look for a community who can support him and coach him before he invests into his new restaurant.
               For him, it will be a good choice to have insurance of his investment in order to avoid future failure. He heard of the hill chamber of commerce
            </li>

            <li>
                Frederic is seeking for a free membership in a chamber of commerce in his area, since he enjoys events and the ability to meet company 
                owners from all over the world. He used to be a member of the Community Shield Chamber of Commerce, but he left because the annual 
                membership costs were too high, and he didn't see any value in continuing with them. So he searches for a good one with free adhesion fees.
