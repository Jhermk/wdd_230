            <li>
                Liza is a 38-year-old nurse who likes to groom her dog at home. She wants to know if there are any
                grooming services that would be best for her pet dog. She accesses the internet using her tablet over
                wifi. She has a bad experience with grooming services before so she prefers to know any recommendations
                or read reviews before visiting any.

                his laptop to access the internet. He is usually busy so he wants something that's closer to home. He
